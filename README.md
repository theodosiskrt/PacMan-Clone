# PacMan-Clone
This is a PacMan clone created using C++ for a University Project.
In order to run it you will need to have the g++ compiler and the lncurses library installed.
Cd into the CppFinal folder and run "g++ *.cpp -lncurses" to compile the code.
Once the compilation is finished run "./a.out" followed by the name of the map file ("maze.txt" for the map I include in the files) as well as a name for the HiScores file which is going to be created at the end of your game (ex. run command: ./a.out maze.txt hiScores.bin).
